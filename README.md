# Food-Ordering-System

**Introduction**
Assignment 2 focuses on processing multiple related information using two-dimensional arrays and modular program design where you are required to develop your program using user-defined functions. It also requires you to write a program that interact with Input/Output files. 


**Problem Statement**
We live in challenging yet interesting times. With COVID-19, social distancing becoming a solid norm and eating in a crowded restaurant is no longer possible. However, we can still enjoy the delicious food from the restaurants by having Food Ordering system. To maintain business, restaurant needs this system to showcase their menu by keeping track the prices, delivery time, number of orders by customers and sales for each item in the menu. The manager will be able to view the total sales, the most popular dish in the menu and number of customers for the day. The pandemic will turn you the system developer into warriors of the modern world.

**Program Specification**
Food Ordering and Delivering system has 2 users, Restaurant Manager and Customer with the following 
basic process:
1. Restaurant Manager(s)
a. Create/update menu
b. Update prices
c. Accept orders
d. Calculate total payments per order
e. Calculate estimated delivery time
f. Calculate total sales for a day
2. Customer(s)
a. Order online
b. Make payments
The system should be user friendly using suitable menu with instructions and easy to navigate with informative display. You may add more users and functions as you wish.

**Data Input/ Output Format**
Use your own creativity to design the input and output. For input, use text file to create menu and prices (use you own format) and updated prices must be stored in text file. For output, you can either display it on the screen or write the output into a file. 

**Assessment Requirements:**
Data validation is compulsory. If any is invalid, print appropriate messages on the screen. Reading and writing to from/to external file should be done only once for a single program run. All data to be processed should use appropriate two-dimensional arrays or parallel arrays and functions according to specific tasks.
